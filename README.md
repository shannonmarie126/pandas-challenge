Summarizes the analysis 
Schhool test data was manipulated to visualize how test scores and passing rates trended based off the variables of spending(pre student), district type, student grade and school size. Highest overall passing were all charter schools, while lowest overall passing schools were all district schools. All scores appeared relatively consistent within schools across grade levels (no statistical tests, but this is the visual trend).Ignoring the lowest spending (per student) value(<$585), all scores and %passing increase with increased spending, this could be due to outlying factors not shown in this datafram, such as district type (charter school spending trends lower). Small and medium scores and passing rates were relatively consistent, while larger schools trended to lower scores and lower passing rates (can not say significantly without a statisitcal test). Charter schools trending higher scores and passing rates than district schools, the rates show a higher differentiation than the scores, suggesting district schools might have more spread data/outliers.
